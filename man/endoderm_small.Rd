\description{
A `vistimeseq` object contating gene expression data, feature
and sample data from a study by Blake et al. "A Comparative Study Of Endoderm
Differentiation In Humans And Chimpanzees". Here we include only a small
fraction of the data including top 250 most variable genes, to serve as
a toy exapmle for vistimeseq.
